# Efficiency-Frontier-and-CML-of-a-N-stock-portfolio

This code is the improved version of my 3-stock-portfolio efficiency frontier and CML. It aims to contruct the efficiency frontier and capital market line of a 
N-stock portfolio. Note the runtime might be very long if N is large or you need to test a large group of combinations of different weightings of the stock.
